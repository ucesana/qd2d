# Quick & Dirty 2D

Quick & Dirty 2D is a lightweight physics and graphics framework written in [Vanilla.js](http://vanilla-js.com/), the most powerful and versatile JavaScript
 framework out there. Actually, I lie, I do use a little JQuery.

## Try it out

Build the project by running the following shell script:

```bash
cd js/build
sh build.sh
```

The script will create a `dist` directory and copy all the necessary files, including all images, JavaScript libraries, css, and the main `qd.js` module.

To run the demo, open up `dist/index.html` in your browser or visit the [live demo](http://users.tpg.com.au/ucesana/projects/qd2d/).

## Why 'Quick & Dirty'?

My Quick & Dirty projects are just experiments I use to learn new algorithms and programming concepts. They are quick to write because I will sacrifice good
 programming standards to just get things working, and they are dirty, because they are guaranteed to contain bugs.
